The Hospital Management System is a role-based web application designed to streamline and digitize hospital operations.
 It supports three main user roles: Admin, Doctor, and Receptionist. Administrators manage the entire system,
  including doctors and system settings; doctors can view appointments and access patient histories;
   while receptionists handle patient registration and appointment scheduling. 
   The system includes core features such as secure user login and authentication, patient and doctor management, 
   appointment booking, in-patient and out-patient tracking, medical record handling, and an integrated billing system.
    Built using Python and Flask, the system employs a structured database with SQLAlchemy and offers a user-friendly
     interface for efficient hospital administration and healthcare management.
